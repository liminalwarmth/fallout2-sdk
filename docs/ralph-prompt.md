"Play Fallout 2, following the quests and improving your character just as a human player would, using the knowledge and resources available to you. Frequently reflect on your context and how your action and problem solving attempts are working out, and propose fixes for any issues that you run into or improvements to your toolkit/sdk harness that would make the game smoother or easier for you to play (as long as they're things a human player could also do in game). Remember that you have access to debug logs you can review if you need them also! Record any issues and your fixes as a bullet with a time stamp in docs/journal.md.

This task is complete when:
- You have recruited Sulik and he's in your party
- You have rescued Vic and he's in your party
- All three of you are equipped with armor and good weapons for your stats
