# Fallout 2 — Interaction Cheat Sheet (Spoiler-Light)

Use this as a practical reference for what you can actually do in the world:
- how to use items on people/objects,
- how to remove obstacles,
- what each skill is useful for.

---

## Core Interaction Model

- **Right-click** changes cursor/action mode (move/use/look behavior).
- **Left-click self** opens inventory.
- **Two hand slots** let you keep two ready items (for example gun + grenade, or gun + dynamite).
- **Skilldex** applies a chosen skill directly to a target.
- **Pip-Boy** handles quests, map, and resting.

How to use an item on a target:
1. Open inventory.
2. Select item.
3. Choose use hand icon.
4. Click target (self, companion, NPC, door, machine, container, etc.).

## Item Interactions That Matter

### Healing and medical items

| Item | What it does | Can target companions? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stimpak | Immediate HP heal | Yes | Bread-and-butter heal in and out of combat |
| Super Stimpak | Big heal + delayed damage | Yes | Powerful but delayed damage can be dangerous |
| Healing Powder | Small heal, Perception penalty | Yes | Common early-game fallback |
| First Aid Kit | Boosts First Aid usage | Yes | Helps with HP recovery checks |
| Doctor's Bag | Boosts Doctor usage (cripples + HP) | Yes | Key field tool for broken limbs |
| Antidote | Reduces/cures poison | Yes | Use when poisoned |
| RadAway | Reduces radiation level | Yes | After radiation exposure |
| Rad-X | Temporarily increases rad resistance | Yes | Use before entering irradiated areas |

Important companion interaction:
- **You can use Stimpaks on companions directly.**
- **You can use Doctor's Bag on companions** (with Doctor skill) to treat crippled limbs.

### Utility / obstacle items

| Item | Typical use |
|---|---|
| Lockpicks / Electronic Lockpicks | Improves lock-opening attempts on doors/containers |
| Tool Kit / Super Tool Kit | Improves Repair interactions with machinery/systems |
| Crowbar | Opens/forces some specific containers/obstacles |
| Dynamite / Plastic Explosives | Destroy some doors/obstacles or trap/kill targets |
| Grenades (frag/plasma/pulse/molotov) | Thrown explosive weapon |

Explosives workflow:
1. Arm/set timer.
2. Place or throw.
3. Move to safe distance.
4. Wait for blast.

## Obstacle Removal Toolkit

When blocked, try in this order:

1. **Normal interaction**: try opening/using the object first.
2. **Lockpick**: apply via Skilldex to locked door/container.
3. **Find key / alternate path**: talk, search, inspect nearby areas.
4. **Science/Repair**: for terminals, control panels, machinery gates.
5. **Explosives**: for destructible physical obstacles.

For trapped objects:
- Use **Traps** skill before opening.

For hostile blockers:
- Use **Speech** first if dialogue exists.
- If combat starts: cripple legs (aimed shots), kite melee enemies, use doorways/chokepoints.

---

## Direct Enemy Interactions

Ways to disable or remove enemies beyond basic shooting:

- **Aimed leg shots**: reduce enemy mobility so melee enemies cannot keep up.
- **Aimed eyes/head shots**: high-risk, high-reward disables/crit outcomes.
- **AP vs JHP ammo swap**:
  - AP for armored targets.
  - JHP for lightly armored targets.
- **Pulse weapons/explosives vs robots**: usually stronger than normal rounds.
- **Steal + planted explosives**: can place armed explosives on NPCs (very risky if detected).
- **Pre-fight chem use on self**:
  - Mentats for dialogue/perception/int checks.
  - Buffout for strength/endurance/agility bump.
  - Psycho for temporary survivability.

If your goal is survival, not loot:
- Use terrain to split groups.
- Retreat to exits if the fight is unwinnable.

## Skills: What They Do and Where to Use Them

### Combat skills

| Skill | Useful for |
|---|---|
| Small Guns | Pistols, rifles, shotguns, SMGs |
| Big Guns | Miniguns, flamers, rocket weapons |
| Energy Weapons | Laser/plasma/pulse guns |
| Unarmed | Punch/kick and special unarmed attacks |
| Melee Weapons | Knives, sledge, spears, melee tools |
| Throwing | Grenades and thrown items |

### World/utility skills

| Skill | Typical targets | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| Lockpick | Doors, containers | Opens locked paths/loot |
| Science | Computers, robots, high-tech systems | Alternate solutions, data access, control |
| Repair | Generators, machines, devices, vehicles | Fixes systems, quest progress |
| Traps | Trapped containers/doors, planted explosives | Detect/disarm traps, safer explosive use |
| First Aid | Self, companions, NPCs | Minor healing and recovery |
| Doctor | Self, companions, NPCs | Better healing, fixes crippled limbs |
| Sneak | Self toggle | Avoid detection, reposition before fights |
| Steal | NPC inventories | Take items or plant items |
| Speech | NPC dialogue checks | Avoid fights, better quest outcomes |
| Barter | Traders | Better buy prices |
| Outdoorsman | World map travel | Fewer random encounters |

### Knowledge/interaction skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Gambling | Win money at gambling tables |
| Sneak + Steal combo | Better positioning for theft/planting |

Rule of thumb:
- If it looks electronic: try **Science**, then **Repair**.
- If it is locked: try **Lockpick**.
- If it looks trapped: try **Traps**.

## Combat Interaction Basics

- Combat is turn-based and AP-driven.
- Common AP costs (varies by weapon): move, attack, reload, use item.
- Reloading in a bad position gets people killed; manage ammo before pushing.

Aimed shots:
- Higher AP and lower base hit chance.
- Better critical outcomes.
- Practical targets:
  - **Eyes/head**: high impact, hard to hit.
  - **Legs**: reduce enemy mobility.
  - **Torso**: safer aimed option.

Ammo switching:
- **AP ammo**: better versus armored enemies.
- **JHP ammo**: better versus unarmored enemies.

Burst caution:
- Burst can hit allies/bystanders.
- Be careful with companion loadouts and firing lanes.

---

## Companion Interactions

What you can directly do:
- Give companions weapons, armor, ammo via trade/barter dialogue.
- Use Stimpaks on companions.
- Use Doctor's Bag on companions to treat cripples.
- Configure some combat behavior through companion dialogue (depends on companion).

High-value habits:
- Keep companion gear current.
- Avoid giving companions burst-fire weapons unless you accept friendly fire risk.
- Carry enough healing to keep the whole party alive.

---

## Exploration and Loot Interactions

- Search containers: lockers, shelves, desks, crates, footlockers, etc.
- Check corpses after combat.
- Examine scenery with look cursor for clues or hidden interactions.
- Skill books grant permanent skill gains up to practical caps.

Inventory discipline:
- Prioritize value-per-weight loot.
- Keep ammo and healing stocked.
- Upgrade armor/weapons early; power spikes are large.

---

## Travel and World Interactions

- World map travel consumes time and can trigger random encounters.
- Outdoorsman helps avoid encounters.
- Car (when obtained) improves travel speed and adds trunk storage.
- Rest via Pip-Boy when safe to recover HP over time.

## Quick "Can I Do This?" Answers

| Goal | Yes — how |
|---|---|
| Heal companion HP | Use Stimpak (or other healing item) on companion |
| Fix companion crippled limb | Use Doctor skill, ideally with Doctor's Bag, on companion |
| Open locked door | Lockpick -> key/search -> Science/Repair path -> explosives |
| Disarm trap | Use Traps skill on trap/door/container |
| Use skill on world object | Open Skilldex, choose skill, click object |
| Beat armored enemies | Use AP ammo, better guns, aimed shots when hit chance allows |
| Avoid a fight | Speech, Sneak, or leave via exit route |
| Use explosives on obstacle | Arm explosive, place, move away, detonate |
| Improve gear effectiveness fast | Upgrade armor tier, use correct ammo type, keep companions equipped |

## Save Discipline (Practical)

- Save before: difficult fights, theft, explosives, major dialogue choices.
- Keep rolling/manual saves by area so you can recover from late-discovered mistakes.
